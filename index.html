    <p>Ray was born in Vancouver, BC, Cananda and moved to Seattle at an age of 6. Born as a nerd he enjoyed playing video games, was always pretty good at math, and never really did sports or anything active for the first 18 years of his life. He went to school at Lake Washington High School and continued his education at University of Washington. Ray continued his nerdiness by joining various nerdy clubs such as Anime club and especially deciding to study engineering for his bachelor. He did however realize that he was quite skinny so he decided to finally start lifting weights to put some meat on those bones. After 4 years of what seemed like hell, he finally graduated and landed a position in the Boeing Company doing nerdy stuff.</p>
    <p>Now as a student in Code Fellows, he is motivated and passionate about pursuing his dreams of becoming the world's best iOS App developer</p>
